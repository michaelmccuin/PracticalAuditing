<h2>Project Walk-Through:</h2>

<p align="center">
Step 1: <br/>
Prior to the on-site audit, I organized meetings with relevant personnel, outlined discussion topics, and proactively requested Standard Operating Procedures and the System Security Plan ahead of time to optimize efficiency and respect their schedule.
<br />
<br />
Step 2:  <br/>
I audited against NIST 800-53 focusing on Media Protection controls MP-1 through MP-8 in section 3.10. https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf
<br />
<br />
Step 3: <br/>
I read and comprehended the control family (3.10 Media Protection), their discussions and related controls, and placed them in a spreadsheet. <br/>

<br />
<br />
Step 4:  <br/>
Data Collection is acquired through interview, testing or documentation. <br/>
This audit gathered evidence of Policy and Procedures (MP-1) through an interview, in which required thorough notetaking. <br/>

<br />
<br />
Step 5:  <br/>
Evidence Detail was gathered during the interview with the Director of IT, Frank Reynolds; he was asked about policies and procedures regarding media protection. <br/>

<br />
<br />
Step 6:  <br/>
Based off the evidence from the interview with Director of IT, Frank Reynolds, the Finding was that "No media protection policy or procedures were available." <br/>

<br />
<br />
Step 7:  <br/>
My disposition as an auditor was that there were no policies and procedures for media protection in place. <br/>

<br />
<br />
Step 8:  <br/>
I then repeated steps 5-8 for each control from MP-2 through MP-8 by means of interviews, testing or documentation. <br/>
