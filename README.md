<h1>Practical Auditing</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

üìä **Overview**
  - Conducted a hands-on practical auditing lab, focusing on [NIST SP 800-53](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf) controls for 3.1 Media Protection (MP-1 through MP-8), with the primary objective of fortifying security practices for information systems within an organization.
    
üîç **Key Points**
  - Control Analysis: Thorough examination and understanding of each control within the Media Protection family.
  - Data Collection: Implementation of a comprehensive audit process involving interviews, testing, and meticulous documentation.
  - Evidence Detail: Recorded key personnel interviews and gathered detailed evidence of policies and procedures for a comprehensive audit trail.

üöÄ **Objectives**
  - Validate compliance with [NIST SP 800-53](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf) controls for Media Protection.
  - Provide clear documentation for objective audit conclusions.
  - Enhance the overall cybersecurity posture of information systems and organizations through effective auditing practices.

<h2>Project Walk-Through:</h2>

**Step 1: Prior Preparation**  
Prior to the on-site audit, I organized meetings with relevant personnel, outlined discussion topics, and proactively requested Standard Operating Procedures and the System Security Plan ahead of time to optimize efficiency and respect their schedule.

**Step 2: NIST 800-53 Audit**  
I audited against [NIST 800-53](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf), focusing on Media Protection controls MP-1 through MP-8 in section 3.10.

**Step 3: Control Family Understanding**  
I read and comprehended the control family (3.10 Media Protection), their discussions, and related controls, and placed them in a spreadsheet. <br/>

**Step 4: Data Collection**  
Data collection involved interviews, testing, or documentation. For example, evidence of Policy and Procedures (MP-1) was gathered through an interview, requiring thorough documentation of key insights. <br/>

**Step 5: Evidence Detailing**  
Evidence detailing was gathered during the interview with the Director of IT, Frank Reynolds, who was asked about policies and procedures regarding media protection. <br/>

**Step 6: Findings**  
Based on the evidence from the interview with Frank Reynolds, the finding was that "No media protection policy or procedures were available." <br/>

**Step 7: Auditor's Disposition**  
My disposition as an auditor was that there were no policies or procedures for media protection in place. <br/>

**Step 8: Repetition for Each Control**  
I then repeated steps 5-8 for each control from MP-2 through MP-8 by means of interviews, testing, or documentation. <br/>
